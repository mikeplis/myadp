      <p>Select "Custom" from the dropdown above, and then input the year and league ID of the MFL leagues you want to use to generate your ADP report.

      <p>Select one or more rows in the table (using your Control, Shift, and/or Command keys) to prevent them from being hidden by
      your filters. This is useful if you want to easily compare one or more players to each other or to another set of players.</p>
